    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic'">
        I am a Middle Aged woman finally jumping into the Tech World.
        I Grew up in Livonia, Michigan in the Clarenceville school district.
        I climbed trees and could play just about any instrument I tried (except flute).
        I went to Eastern Michigan University for a short while Majoring in Biology and minoring in Music Theory.
        I received a small music scholarship to EMU and was allowed to use my Highschool's $6k Mark VI Tenor SAX
